          <h5>Data Protection</h5>
          <p>We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative security procedures to safeguard all data in our possession against loss, misuse and unauthorized access. For an example we regularly update software to ensure it complies with the latest security standards. We use encrypted payment systems to protect your financial transactions and we comply with PCI-DSS requirements. We have also installed secure access controls, such as key cards to prevent unauthorized entry to the gym facilities.</p>

            There might be need to share information with the authorities, if there are some legal requirements or they request these information’s. 
            In addition to these, there are some optional services that need personal information.  However, these aren’t mandatory and accepting information sharing is always asked separately. These are analytics services, which are used to improve gym and service levels.  </p>
          <h6>Ensuring Information security </h6>
          <p>Our employers are well informed with information security. That’s because we have formed training events for them. In these events have been lecturers that are industry professionals. We have also online trainings that the employers must done. Confidentiality is base for everything, and that’s the reason why we approach information security with great precision. </p>
